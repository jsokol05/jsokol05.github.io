	<h2>HUMAN FACTORS ENGINEER | TECHNOLOGIST | BIG THINKER</h2>
	<p>Hello there! I am a junior at Tufts University School of Engineering majoring in Human Factors Engineering. I am 20 years old and hail from the North Shore area of Boston. My interests lie in design of the physical and virtual world, and understanding people's needs and interests to constantly improve designs.</p>

	<p>I've conducted human subjects research on autonomy and attention, designed a knowledge management system for an R&D firm, and worked with a startup to understand the college demographic and launch and improve their product.</p>

	<p>When I'm not focusing on my work and studies, you can find me singing Jewish a cappella (shout outs to <a href="https://shirappeal.com/">Shir Appeal</a>!), scouting down the absolute BEST bowl of ramen in Boston, or thrifting new outfits. </p>

	<p>Explore my site to learn more about the work I've done and what I've learned along the way!</p>
